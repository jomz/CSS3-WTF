Did you know CSS can make your links unclickable? Neither did I..
This repository is a proof-of-concept. You will need the [Serve][1] and [Compass][2] gems to run this:

* sudo gem install serve
* sudo gem install compass
* git clone git://github.com/jomz/CSS3-WTF.git
* cd CSS3-WTF
* serve

.. and surf to localhost:4000

At the time of writing, you can also see the 'bug' in action on http://www.commercieleinnovatie.be/wie-doet-mee/2008-2010/
Try to click on any link in the second or third column to see what I mean.
